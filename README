These are my solutions to the first few problems of project euler www.projecteuler.net

I am working through these problems using different languages to keep my skills sharp.

The languages used so far are Java, Ruby and Haskell.

These problems were run on the following version of Ruby:
ruby 1.9.3p0 (2011-10-30 revision 33570) [x86_64-darwin11.2.0]

These problems were run on the following version of Haskell:
Glasgow Haskell Compiler, Version 7.0.4, for Haskell 98, stage 2 booted by GHC version 6.12.3

Java V6.  Occasionally using Guava and Apache Commons libraries since Java was lacking.

Thanks,

Adam
