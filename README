These are my solutions to the first 20 problems of project euler
It was fun coding these problems in a very friendly and maleable language like ruby.

These are free for anyone to use.  Please try the problems on your own first.

These problems were run on the following version of ruby:
ruby 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09 revision 32553) [x86_64-darwin11.0.0]

Thanks,
